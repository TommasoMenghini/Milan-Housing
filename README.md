# Milan Housing — Price Prediction with Generalized Additive Models

This repository contains a complete statistical analysis aimed at predicting **house market prices in Milan** using **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)**.  
The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, missing-value imputation, exploratory analysis, model specification, and validation.

The analysis is fully documented through markdown reports and reproducible R scripts.

## Repository structure

## Overview

The dataset consists of residential properties located within the municipality of Milan, described by structural, locational, and building-related characteristics.  
The response variable is the **selling price**, modeled on the logarithmic scale to ensure positivity of predictions and to reduce the influence of extreme values.

Exploratory analysis highlights clear **non-linear relationships** between the response and some key covariates, motivating the use of GAMs rather than purely linear models.

## Methodology

### Data preprocessing
- Cleaning and standardization of raw variables
- Extraction of additional features from textual fields
- Consistency checks across related variables
- Treatment of implausible values

### Missing values
Missing data are handled via **iterative regression imputation**, rather than listwise deletion, in order to preserve information and reduce bias.  
Each partially observed variable is imputed conditionally on the others using appropriate univariate models (linear or ordinal regression).

### Modeling
A **Generalized Additive Model** is fitted on the log-transformed selling price:
- selected covariates enter the model through smooth terms;
- remaining predictors are included linearly;
- smoothing parameters are selected via **REML**.

The additive structure ensures interpretability of covariate effects while allowing for flexible functional forms.

### Evaluation
Model performance is assessed on a validation set using the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** computed on the original price scale.

---

## Results

The final GAM achieves a validation **MAE of approximately €78,938**, meaning that the average absolute deviation between predicted and observed prices is about €79,000.

Considering the high variability and wide range of housing prices in the Milan real estate market, this level of error is reasonable and indicates that the model captures a substantial portion of the underlying price structure.

Further details, diagnostics, and graphical results are reported in `modelling.md`.

## Reproducibility

### Requirements
- R (≥ 4.0)
- Packages used include: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `mgcv`, `MASS`, `skimr`, `naniar`, `gratia`, `broom`, among others.

### Running the analysis
Set the working directory to the repository root and run the scripts in `R/` following the logical order:
1. preprocessing and data cleaning;
2. modeling and validation.

All figures generated by the scripts are stored in `img/`.
